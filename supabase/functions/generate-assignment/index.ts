2. Establish a baseline for progress tracking
3. Inform future lesson planning
4. Adapt difficulty level to student's current abilities

Make questions diagnostic - covering key concepts and skills from throughout the course at varying difficulty levels.

CROSS-SUBJECT INTEGRATION - CRITICAL:
This is a multi-course assignment with cross-subject integration enabled. Advanced analysis has identified high-quality opportunities to naturally incorporate weak areas:

TOP PRIORITY INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES (sorted by quality):
${integrationPlan.slice(0, 5).map((integration, idx) => `
${idx + 1}. WEAK AREA: ${integration.weak_area.subject} - ${integration.weak_area.standard_code}
   Mastery: ${integration.weak_area.mastery_level}% | Priority Score: ${integration.weak_area.priority_score}
   Quality: ${integration.quality_score}/100 | Naturalness: ${integration.naturalness_rating.toUpperCase()}
   
   INTEGRATION SUGGESTIONS:
   ${integration.integration_suggestions.map((s: string) => `   • ${s}`).join('\n')}
   
   TARGET COURSES: ${integration.target_courses.join(', ')}
`).join('\n')}

INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Design ONE cohesive assignment that addresses the main topic "${topic}" across ALL selected courses
2. Use the integration suggestions above to naturally weave in weak area practice
3. Focus on HIGH and MEDIUM naturalness integrations - they will feel most authentic to students
4. Make connections explicit but not forced (e.g., "As we analyze this historical data, we'll also practice the fraction operations we've been working on")
5. Include standards_alignment_by_course showing which standards from each course are addressed
6. Explain in teacher_guide how the cross-subject integration strengthens learning

QUALITY METRICS:
- ${integrationPlan.filter(i => i.naturalness_rating === 'high').length} high-quality integrations available
- ${integrationPlan.filter(i => i.naturalness_rating === 'medium').length} medium-quality integrations available
- Average integration quality: ${Math.round(integrationPlan.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.quality_score, 0) / integrationPlan.length)}/100

This maximizes learning time by addressing multiple subjects and targeted weak areas simultaneously while maintaining natural flow.
