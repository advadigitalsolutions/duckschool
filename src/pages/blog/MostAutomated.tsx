                Homeschooling doesn't mean doing everything yourself. AI handles diagnostics, curriculum, grading, and scheduling—you provide love, encouragement, and snacks.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">The Homeschool Parent Burnout Epidemic</h2>
              <p>
                Here's the reality no one tells you about homeschooling: You're not just a parent—you're suddenly a teacher, curriculum coordinator, administrator, guidance counselor, librarian, and education researcher. All while still being expected to cook, clean, manage schedules, and maintain your sanity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most homeschool parents spend:
              </p>
              <ul className="space-y-2">
                <li>20+ hours per week researching curriculum and lesson planning</li>
                <li>15+ hours per week actively teaching</li>
                <li>10+ hours per week grading and assessing work</li>
                <li>5+ hours per week managing schedules and tracking progress</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                That's 50 hours per week—on top of regular parenting responsibilities. No wonder burnout is the number one reason families quit homeschooling.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">What if AI Did 80% of That Work?</h2>
              <p>
                SmartCore automates nearly every administrative and instructional task in homeschooling—leaving you free to focus on what actually matters: being a parent who encourages, supports, and celebrates your child's learning journey.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Automated Feature #1: Diagnostic Assessment</h2>
              <p>
                Traditional homeschooling: You spend weeks testing your child across subjects, trying to figure out what they know and don't know. You guess at grade level. You hope you're starting in the right place.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>SmartCore:</strong> 30-minute adaptive diagnostic per subject. The AI identifies exact mastery levels, knowledge gaps, and prerequisite skills. Your child starts exactly where they need to be—no guessing required.
              </p>
              <p className="italic text-muted-foreground">
                Time saved: 20+ hours at start of year, ongoing diagnostic refinement happens automatically
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Automated Feature #2: Personalized Curriculum Generation</h2>
              <p>
                Traditional homeschooling: Research dozens of curriculum options. Read reviews. Buy expensive materials. Realize three months in it doesn't fit your child's learning style. Start over.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>SmartCore:</strong> AI generates a complete, standards-aligned curriculum customized to your child's level, learning style, pace, and state requirements. Updates automatically as they progress.
              </p>
              <p className="italic text-muted-foreground">
                Time saved: 40+ hours of research, $500-$1000 in trial-and-error curriculum purchases
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Automated Feature #3: Adaptive Lesson Delivery</h2>
              <p>
                Traditional homeschooling: You teach the lesson. Child doesn't get it. You try explaining differently. Still doesn't click. You search YouTube for better explanations. Spend an hour on a concept that was supposed to take 20 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>SmartCore:</strong> AI delivers lessons through multiple modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic). Detects confusion in real-time and adjusts approach automatically. Provides hints, examples, and scaffolding exactly when needed.
              </p>
              <p className="italic text-muted-foreground">
                Time saved: 10-15 hours per week of active teaching
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Automated Feature #4: Immediate Grading and Feedback</h2>
              <p>
                Traditional homeschooling: Child finishes math worksheet. You grade it later (if you remember). Child has moved on and doesn't care anymore. You spend evenings grading instead of relaxing.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>SmartCore:</strong> Instant grading with detailed explanations. Child sees immediately if they understood the concept. AI identifies patterns in mistakes and adjusts future lessons accordingly.
              </p>
              <p className="italic text-muted-foreground">
                Time saved: 10+ hours per week of grading
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Automated Feature #5: Smart Scheduling</h2>
              <p>
                Traditional homeschooling: You manually plan what to teach each day. Try to balance subjects. Forget what you taught last week. Realize you've been doing math for three hours and forgot science entirely.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>SmartCore:</strong> AI generates optimized daily schedules based on your family's availability, your child's energy patterns, and curriculum pacing. Automatically adjusts if you miss a day or need to slow down.
              </p>
              <p className="italic text-muted-foreground">
                Time saved: 5+ hours per week of planning and schedule management
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Automated Feature #6: Progress Tracking and Reporting</h2>
              <p>
                Traditional homeschooling: Manually log what your child completed. Try to remember what they struggled with. Compile documentation for your state. Panic because you didn't keep good records.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>SmartCore:</strong> Comprehensive progress dashboard showing exactly what's been mastered, what's in progress, and what's coming next. State-compliant reports generated automatically. No manual tracking required.
              </p>
              <p className="italic text-muted-foreground">
                Time saved: 5+ hours per week of record-keeping and documentation
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Automated Feature #7: Learning Path Optimization</h2>
              <p>
                Traditional homeschooling: Child aces fractions but struggles with word problems. You're not sure if you should move forward or review. You make your best guess and hope it works out.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>SmartCore:</strong> AI analyzes performance patterns and automatically adjusts the learning path. Advances in areas of strength. Provides additional practice and alternative approaches in areas of struggle.
              </p>
              <p className="italic text-muted-foreground">
                Time saved: Ongoing instructional decisions made automatically
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Automated Feature #8: Resource Curation</h2>
              <p>
                Traditional homeschooling: Spend hours searching for supplementary materials. Bookmark 47 websites you'll never look at again. Buy books that sit unread.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>SmartCore:</strong> AI curates relevant videos, articles, interactive simulations, and practice materials for each lesson. Everything your child needs is included—no hunting required.
              </p>
              <p className="italic text-muted-foreground">
                Time saved: 5+ hours per week of resource hunting
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">What's Left for You to Do?</h2>
              <p>
                With 80% of instructional and administrative work automated, here's what homeschool parents using SmartCore actually spend time on:
              </p>
              <ul className="space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Encouragement:</strong> "I'm so proud of how hard you're working on this!"</li>
                <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Gentle check-ins to keep kids on track</li>
                <li><strong>Enrichment:</strong> Field trips, hands-on projects, real-world experiences</li>
                <li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Deep conversations about what they're learning</li>
                <li><strong>Celebration:</strong> Acknowledging progress and effort</li>
                <li><strong>Snacks:</strong> Never underestimate the importance of snacks</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In other words: You get to be a parent, not a full-time teacher.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">The "But I Want to Teach!" Concern</h2>
              <p>
                Some parents worry: "If AI does all the teaching, am I even homeschooling anymore?"
              </p>
              <p>
                Yes. Here's why:
              </p>
              <ul className="space-y-2">
                <li>You're making the educational decisions (what to prioritize, when to take breaks, what enrichment to add)</li>
                <li>You're providing the emotional support that no AI can replicate</li>
                <li>You're modeling lifelong learning and curiosity</li>
                <li>You're available for questions, discussions, and guidance</li>
                <li>You're customizing the experience to your family's values and goals</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                You're still homeschooling. You're just not drowning in busywork anymore.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">What Parents Tell Us</h2>
              <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 italic my-6">
                "I was spending 6 hours a day teaching and grading. Now I spend 30 minutes checking in and encouraging my kids. The rest of my day is mine again. And my kids are learning MORE, not less."
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 italic my-6">
                "I almost quit homeschooling because I was so overwhelmed. SmartCore saved us. The AI handles everything I was drowning in, and I get to actually enjoy learning alongside my children."
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 italic my-6">
                "I used to feel guilty on days I was too tired to teach effectively. Now the AI delivers consistent, high-quality instruction every day. I can be the encourager and guide instead of the exhausted teacher."
              </blockquote>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">The Bottom Line</h2>
              <p>
                Homeschooling should be about giving your child a personalized education—not about martyring yourself to endless busywork.
              </p>
              <p>
                AI doesn't replace your role as a parent. It eliminates the administrative and instructional tasks that drain your time and energy, so you can focus on what humans do best: encouraging, inspiring, and loving your child through their learning journey.
              </p>
              <p className="text-xl font-semibold">
                Work smarter, not harder. Teach less, parent more. Automate everything else.
